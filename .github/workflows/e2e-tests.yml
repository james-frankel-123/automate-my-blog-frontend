              **Why this often happens:**
              - **Overlay blocking clicks** — In CI, the webpack dev server error overlay can appear and intercept pointer events. The E2E suite removes it via \`installOverlayRemover\` / \`removeOverlay\`; flakiness may mean the overlay reappeared.
              - **Timing / animations** — Typewriter or other UI animations may not finish within timeouts in CI; tests that assert on specific copy may need to assert on stable elements (e.g. workflow start screen) instead.
              - **Environment** — E2E runs with \`REACT_APP_GIT_COMMIT_SHA=dev\` and \`REACT_APP_STREAMING_ENABLED=false\` via \`npm run start:e2e\`.

              **What to do:** Check the **playwright-report** and **test-screenshots** artifacts from this run for the failing test and screenshot. Re-run the workflow if the failure looks flaky.`
