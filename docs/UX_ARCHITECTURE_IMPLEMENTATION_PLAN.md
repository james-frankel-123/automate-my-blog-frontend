# UX Architecture Implementation Plan
## Comprehensive Requirements for Focus Mode vs Workflow Mode

### Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the UX architecture redesign, focusing on the dual-mode system (Focus Mode vs Workflow Mode) with seamless tab transitions and progressive stacking headers.

## Current Status ✅
- **Tab Structure Updated**: Dashboard → Audience Segments → Posts → Analytics → Settings
- **Automation Settings Migrated**: Moved from Discovery to Settings → Content Discovery tab  
- **Brand Colors Removed**: Completely eliminated non-working brand colors system
- **Progressive Headers Created**: ProgressiveHeaders component with systemVoice labels (“We know your site”, “Audience locked in”, “Topic chosen”, “Content ready”); step enter animations
- **Terminology Updated**: All references now use "Create New Post"
- **WorkflowModeContext**: Implemented and in use (DashboardLayout, DashboardTab, PostsTab, AudienceSegmentsTab); workflow vs focus mode, step progression, progressive headers
- **Motion & transitions**: Design tokens in `design-system.css` (`--transition-step`, `--transition-reveal`, `--stagger-delay`); staggered topic card reveal; step enter animations
- **System voice**: Headers and step copy use `src/copy/systemVoice.js` (see docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_FROM_USABILITY_PROPOSAL.md and PR_UX_ONE_VOICE.md)

## Remaining Implementation Requirements

### 1. Focus Mode vs Workflow Mode System

#### Core Concept
Two distinct interaction patterns within each tab:

**Workflow Mode** (Guided Experience):
- Streamlined UI focused on single task completion
- "Next" buttons that auto-advance to next tab
- Contextual guidance and progress indicators  
- Auto-scroll between tabs with smooth animations
- Simplified options to prevent decision paralysis
- Progressive stacking headers show completed steps

**Focus Mode** (Power User Experience):
- Full feature set for deep work within single tab
- Complete management capabilities (create, edit, delete, organize)
- No workflow progression - tab independence
- Advanced filtering, sorting, batch operations
- No stacking headers - standard tab navigation

#### Mode Toggle Mechanism
```javascript
// Workflow Mode Entry Points:
- Dashboard: "Create New Post" button → guided flow
- Completed workflow step: "Continue Creation" → resume flow  
- First-time user experience → automatic workflow mode

// Focus Mode Entry Points:
- Any tab direct navigation → focus mode
- "View All [Items]" button from workflow mode
- "Manage [Section]" buttons
- Power user returning to manage existing content

// Mode Indicators:
- Workflow mode: Progress header + contextual guidance
- Focus mode: Standard tab UI + full feature set
- Easy toggle: "Exit Workflow" / "Continue Creation" buttons
```

### 2. Per-Tab Implementation Requirements

#### Dashboard Tab
**Workflow Mode:**
- "Create New Post" primary CTA leads to guided flow
- AI suggestions with "Use This Idea" buttons that start workflow
- Simple stats overview
- Clear entry point messaging

**Focus Mode:**
- Complete analytics dashboard
- All discovery insights management
- Historical data and trends
- Advanced filtering and reporting

#### Audience Segments Tab  
**Workflow Mode:**
- "Select target audience" with streamlined segment picker
- Create new segment inline if needed
- Limited to essential options
- "Continue to Posts" button advances workflow

**Focus Mode:**
- Complete segment library with create/edit/delete
- Performance analysis per segment
- A/B testing capabilities
- Advanced segmentation tools
- Bulk operations

#### Posts Tab
**Workflow Mode:**
- "Generate content for [selected audience]" focused creation
- Streamlined editor with essential options
- Direct path from generation → editing → scheduling
- Context preserved from previous workflow steps

**Focus Mode:**
- All posts management (drafts, published, scheduled)
- Advanced editing tools
- Bulk operations and filtering
- Complete scheduling pipeline
- Content analytics and optimization

### 3. Progressive Stacking Headers Enhancement

#### Requirements
- Each completed workflow step collapses into fixed header row
- Headers stack vertically as user progresses through workflow
- Clickable headers return to that step for editing
- Works for both logged-in (with left menu) and logged-out users (full-width)

#### Header Content Structure
```
🏢 Company Header: "TechStartup.com • B2B SaaS • SMB Target [Edit]"
👥 Audience Header: "Working Parents (ages 25-40) • Career-focused [Edit]"  
✍️ Content Header: "Managing Work-Life Balance Tips • Draft Ready [Edit]"
```

#### Interaction Model
- Headers maintain context across tab navigation
- Edit buttons return to that workflow step in Workflow Mode
- Visual consistency with existing workflow styling
- Auto-scroll to appropriate tab when header clicked
- Headers only visible in Workflow Mode

### 4. Vertical Navigation with Auto-scroll

#### Movement Pattern
- User progresses UP/DOWN through tabs (not left/right)
- Auto-scroll animation between tabs when workflow step completed
- Smooth 800ms transitions with offset for sticky headers
- Tab activation follows scroll position
- Horizontal progress indicators remain for familiarity

#### Implementation Pattern
```javascript
const nextWorkflowStep = (completedData) => {
  // Save completed step data to stacking header
  addToProgressiveHeaders(currentStep, completedData);
  
  // Auto-scroll to next tab
  const nextTab = workflowTabOrder[currentStep + 1];
  autoScrollToTab(nextTab, {
    smooth: true,
    duration: 800,
    offset: -headerHeight
  });
  
  // Activate next tab in workflow mode
  setActiveTab(nextTab);
  setWorkflowMode(true);
};
```

### 5. Logged-out User Experience

#### Requirements
- Same stacking header behavior without left sidebar
- Full-width content area (no left menu)
- Identical workflow progression mechanics
- Seamless transition when user registers mid-workflow
- No loss of context or progress during authentication

#### Visual Differences
- No left sidebar menu (anonymous users)
- Headers stack in same pattern but full-width
- Workflow progression identical to logged-in experience
- Registration prompts at strategic workflow moments

### 6. Implementation Architecture

#### State Management
```javascript
// Global Workflow Context
const WorkflowContext = {
  mode: 'workflow' | 'focus',
  currentStep: number,
  completedSteps: array,
  progressiveHeaders: array,
  workflowData: {
    company: object,
    audience: object, 
    content: object
  }
}

// Per-Tab State
const TabModeContext = {
  isWorkflowMode: boolean,
  workflowStep: number,
  focusModeData: object
}
```

#### Component Structure
```
WorkflowProvider (Global State)
├── DashboardLayout
│   ├── ProgressiveHeaders (Workflow Mode Only)
│   ├── LeftSidebar (Logged-in Only)
│   └── TabContent
│       ├── DashboardTab (Dual Mode)
│       ├── AudienceSegmentsTab (Dual Mode)
│       ├── PostsTab (Dual Mode)
│       ├── AnalyticsTab (Focus Only)
│       └── SettingsTab (Focus Only)
```

### 7. File Structure Changes Needed

#### New Files to Create:
- `/src/contexts/WorkflowModeContext.js` - Global workflow state
- `/src/hooks/useWorkflowMode.js` - Mode management hook
- `/src/components/Workflow/ModeToggle.js` - Switch between modes
- `/src/components/Workflow/WorkflowGuide.js` - Contextual guidance
- `/src/utils/workflowNavigation.js` - Auto-scroll and navigation

#### Files to Modify:
- `/src/components/Dashboard/DashboardLayout.js` - Integrate workflow context
- `/src/components/Dashboard/DashboardTab.js` - Add dual mode support
- `/src/components/Dashboard/AudienceSegmentsTab.js` - Add dual mode support  
- `/src/components/Dashboard/PostsTab.js` - Add dual mode support
- `/src/components/Workflow/ProgressiveHeaders.js` - Enhanced functionality
- `/src/hooks/useWorkflowState-v2.js` - Mode state integration

### 8. Testing Requirements

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage:
1. **Mode Transitions**: Workflow ↔ Focus mode in each tab
2. **Header Stacking**: Progressive header accumulation and interaction
3. **Auto-scroll**: Smooth tab transitions during workflow
4. **Anonymous Experience**: Full workflow without authentication
5. **Authentication Transition**: Preserve state during login/register
6. **Tab Independence**: Focus mode works without workflow context
7. **Settings Integration**: Content Discovery automation controls
8. **Cross-browser**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox compatibility
9. **Mobile**: Responsive behavior on all devices
10. **Performance**: Smooth animations and transitions
