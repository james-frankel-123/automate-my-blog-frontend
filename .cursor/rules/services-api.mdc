# Services / API Layer

- **Contracts**: Request/response shapes and endpoints must match `docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md`. Do not change API contracts without updating that doc and checking backend compatibility.
- **Base**: Use the shared client in `src/services/api.js` for HTTP; keep endpoint paths and payloads consistent with the spec.
- **Errors**: Handle errors explicitly; surface meaningful messages for UI. Do not swallow errors.
- **Streaming/SSE**: Follow existing job stream and SSE patterns; see `docs/` for streaming contracts.
