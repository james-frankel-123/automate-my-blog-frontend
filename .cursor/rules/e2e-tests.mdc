# E2E Tests (Playwright)

- **Location**: All E2E specs and helpers live under `e2e/`. Use `e2e/utils/test-helpers.js` for shared helpers.
- **Selectors**: Prefer `data-testid`, `name`, or stable text; avoid brittle CSS classes. When changing UI, update selectors in the same PR.
- **Resilience**: Wait for elements to be visible before interacting; handle async/loading states. Use conditional checks when elements may be missing.
- **Scope**: Test user flows and behavior, not implementation details. Keep tests independent and avoid relying on global state.
- **Docs**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for when and how to update E2E tests after UI changes.
